        Pretty little baby (ya-ya)
        Pretty little baby (ya-ya)
        Pretty little baby, you say that maybe
        You'll be thinkin' of me and try to love me
        Pretty little baby, I'm hoping that you do
        You can ask the flowers, I sit for hours
        Tellin' all the bluebirds, the bill and coo birds
        Pretty little baby, I'm so in love with you
        Now is just the time, while both of us are young
        Puppy love must have its day
        Don't you know it's much more fun to love
        While the heart is young and gay?
        Meet me at the car hop or at the pop shop   
        Meet me in the moonlight or in the daylight
        Pretty little baby, I'm so in love with you (ah-ah)
        Now is just the time, while both of us are young
        Puppy love must have its day
        Don't you know it's much more fun to love
        While the heart is young and gay?
        Meet me at the car hop or at the pop shop
        Meet me in the moonlight or in the daylight
        Pretty little baby, I'm so in love with you 
        Pretty little baby
        I said, pretty little baby
        Oh, now, pretty little baby
        I said
